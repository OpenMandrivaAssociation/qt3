You should not need to set QTDIR because it should already been automatically
configured (in '/etc/profile.d/qt.sh' and '/etc/profile.d/qt.csh').

To check if it is the case, do 'echo $QTDIR'. Answer should be '/usr/lib/qt3'.

If it is not the case, do 'export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3' if you use bash or
'setenv QTDIR /usr/lib/qt3/' if you use csh.

Qt documentation is in /usr/lib/doc/qt3-QtVersion/ (you need to
install package libqt3-devel-PackageVersion if it is not already
done).

Other Qt things are in /usr/lib/qt3/ (which contains needed symlinks
to create a fake QTDIR).

Examples and tutorials are compressed to save space. If you want to use them,
you need to uncompress them somewhere in your home directory using:
'tar jxf /usr/lib/doc/qt3--QtVersion your_directory'.

XFT support (Anti Aliasing) is enable by default. The QT_XFT environmental
variable is setted in '/etc/profile.d/qt.sh' and '/etc/profile.d/qt.csh'.
